# Proxy Server Implementation

This Java program implements a simple proxy server that handles HTTP requests only. It intercepts requests from clients, forwards them to web servers, and caches the responses for future use.

## Usage

To run the proxy server, follow these steps:

### Without IDE
1. Compile the Java files using the `javac` command.
```
javac ProxyServer.java RequestHandler.java
``` 
2. Run the `ProxyServer` class with the desired port number as a command-line argument.
```
java ProxyServer <port> 
```
### With IDE
Just open the program in your IDE, specicy the port number then hit `Run ‚ñ∂Ô∏è`
